        <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.</p>
        <p>It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.</p>
        <p>A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.</p>
        <p> Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries</p>
        <p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey</p>
        <p>Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.</p>
        <p>A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species</p>
